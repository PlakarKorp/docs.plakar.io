## Sponsoring

Working on `plakar` takes [considerable efforts](https://github.com/poolpOrg/plakar/commits/main) and does not pay bills,
most work happens during spare time.
You can support the project by sponsoring development so that I can dedicate days to it rather than to freelance gigs for proprietary software.


### Recurring sponsorship

You make a monthly donation of **an amount that is sustainable to you** even if it seems too small to be useful.
Enough donations can allow me to dedicate entire days to the project.

You can sponsor through the [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/poolpOrg) (*preferred*) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gilles) programs.


### Donations

If you don't want to become a recurring sponsor but still want to make a one-time donation,
you can do so via [Paypal](https://paypal.me/poolpOrg).
Don't forget to mention that the donation is in support for this project,
this will allow me to keep track of priorities as I also work on other projects.


### Sponsored developments

A feature request can be prioritized in exchange for a pre-agreed bounty (as in money, not as in chocolate bar).
All sponsored developments are meant to become available to the community,
the feature merge will mention the sponsor in the commit log and when advertised on social medias and this website (unless requested not to).

This is opened to both individuals and companies,
however companies will be handled as a freelance gig and an invoice will be produced.
