With a very clear goal to simplify backups, it is designed to be straightforward to use. It requires a few seconds to install and only a few minutes to get backups set up and running: creating a backup is as simple as typing plakar backup and restoring as simple as typing plakar restore.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><lastBuildDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:00:00 +0100</lastBuildDate><atom:link href="https://docs.plakar.io/en/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Quickstart</title><link>https://docs.plakar.io/en/quickstart/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.plakar.io/en/quickstart/index.html</guid><description>This article will guide you through the creation of your first backup with plakar.

Repositories At the core of plakar are backup repositories.
A backup repository is a storage unit within which backups are stored. You can have one or many different repositories, some encrypted and others not, synchronized one with each other or not, and each backed by a local filesystem, a mounted filesystem, an object storage or even a remote server.</description></item><item><title>Commands</title><link>https://docs.plakar.io/en/commands/index.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 23:27:47 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.plakar.io/en/commands/index.html</guid><description>Documented commands Plakar</description></item><item><title>Community</title><link>https://docs.plakar.io/en/community/index.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 23:27:47 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.plakar.io/en/community/index.html</guid><description>Join the Plakar community !
