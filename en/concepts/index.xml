Repositories At the core of plakar are repositories.
A repository is a storage unit within which backups are stored. You can have one or many different repositories, some encrypted and others not, each backed by your local filesystem, a database or even a remote server.
They should be considered as locations, rather than directories: you point the utility there so it can store snapshots or retrieve data from snapshots.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://docs.plakar.io/en/concepts/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
