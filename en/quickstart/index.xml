Installing plakar The first step is to install the software.
At the time of this writing, we do not yet provide packages and plakar has to be installed manually:
$ go install https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/cmd/plakar@latest This will ensure that dependencies are installed and you should be able to verify the command is properly installed:
$ plakar version v0.4.27-alpha $ Running the local agent To work efficiently, plakar requires each user to run a local agent that will provide caching among other things. If the agent is not running, the plakar CLI will operate in degraded mode as a safety net, but will disallow concurrent commands and wonâ€™t benefit from caching.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://docs.plakar.io/en/quickstart/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
