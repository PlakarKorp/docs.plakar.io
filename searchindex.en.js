Two questions often arise: “Why do I need more than one copy?” and “How many copies should I have?”\nWhy do I need more than one copy? If you store your data at a single location, you are at risk of losing everything if that storage fails. This can happen due to various reasons, such as:\nHardware failure: The device’s components can fail due to wear and tear, overheating, or other issues. Power surges: Unexpected power surges can damage the device and corrupt the data. Natural disasters: Fires, floods, earthquakes, or other natural disasters can destroy the device and the data stored on it. Theft: The device can be stolen, and the data can be lost or compromised. Hardware failures are not the only risk to your data. Human errors can also lead to data loss. Some common scenarios include:\nAccidental deletion: A system administrator can accidentally remove the data. Intentional deletion: A malicious actor can delete the data to cause harm. Internal threats: While rare, internal threats can also lead to data loss. A good backup strategy should account for these risks.\nHow many copies should I have? Literature and empirical studies suggest that the annual probability of data loss at a single site—especially when considering factors like hardware failures, human error, and environmental risks—is typically in the low single-digit percentages.\nFor example, a seminal study by Pinheiro, Weber, and Barroso (2007) titled “Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population” found that hard drive failure rates generally fall in the range of 2% to 4% per year.\nIn practice, when additional risks beyond basic hardware failure (such as accidental deletion or other operational issues) are factored in, many practitioners adopt a conservative estimate of around 5% per year for a single site.\nAssuming that the annual probability of data loss at a single site is ( p = 0.05 ) (5%).\nFor a single set of data The annual probability of loss is simply:\n$$p = 0.05$$\nwhich corresponds to a 1 in 20 chance of losing the data.\nFor two copies at distinct sites With two copies at distinct sites, data is only lost if both sites lose their copies simultaneously.\nIf we assume that each site’s failure occurs uniformly at random over 365 days. The daily failure probability for a single site is:\n$$\\frac{p}{365}$$\nThus, the probability that both copies fail on the same day is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{p}{365}\\right)^2$$\nSince there are 365 days in a year, the annual probability of a simultaneous failure is approximately:\n$$365 \\times \\left(\\frac{p}{365}\\right)^2 = \\frac{p^2}{365}$$\nFor p=0.05, this becomes:\n$$\\frac{0.0025}{365} \\approx 6.85 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nwhich corresponds to roughly a 1 in 145,000 chance of both copies failing on the same day over the course of a year.\nFor three copies at distinct sites Similarly, the probability that all three copies fail on the same day is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{p}{365}\\right)^3$$\nOver the year, the probability becomes:\n$$365 \\times \\left(\\frac{p}{365}\\right)^3 = \\frac{p^3}{365^2}$$\nFor ( p = 0.05 ), this calculates to:\n$$\\frac{0.000125}{133225} \\approx 9.38 \\times 10^{-10}$$\nor roughly a 1 in 1 billion chance.\nThese calculations show that while data loss at a single site is a very likely scenario, the odds reduce drastically with a second copy at a distinct site and become irrelevant with a third copy at a third site.\nIt is generally recommended to have the live data + 2 off-site copies to fall in the unlikely 1 in a billion chance range. This is also known as the 3-2-1 backup strategy.",

    "content": "This article will guide you through the creation of your first backup with plakar.\nInstalling plakar Requisites At the time of this writing, we do not yet provide packages and plakar has to be compiled from source, which requires the Go toolchain to be installed on your system.\nTo install the Go toolchain, please refer to the official documentation or run the following commands:\nMacOS: brew install go Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates golang OpenBSD: doas pkg_add go By default, plakar is installed in ~/go/bin. Run export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin to add it to your PATH.\nInstall plakar:\n$ go install github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/cmd/plakar@latest To verify the installation was successful, run:\n$ plakar version v1.0.1-beta.13 Running the local agent To work efficiently, plakar requires each user to run a local agent that will provide caching among other things. If the agent is not running, the plakar CLI will operate in degraded mode as a safety net, but will disallow concurrent commands and won’t benefit from caching.\nStart the agent:\n$ plakar agent agent started with pid=12539 The agent can be stopped with the following command:\n$ plakar agent -stop If you follow the quickstart but the agent is not running, a warning message will be displayed for each command. You can safely ignore this message: the agent is not mandatory but recommended for optimal performance. This warning can be removed by setting the PLAKAR_AGENTLESS environment variable as such export PLAKAR_AGENTLESS=\nCreating your first local repository The plakar software reads your data, splits it into smaller chunks that it deduplicates and stores in a repository, a fancy word to designate storage space dedicated to hold these chunks.\nA repository can be a directory on your local filesystem, a mountpoint to your NAS, a remote directory over SFTP, a bucket on an S3 object store, or any storage we provide (or you write) a connector for.\nOur first repository will be a directory at /var/backups:\n$ plakar at /var/backups create repository passphrase: repository passphrase (confirm): Your passphrase is important Be extra careful when chosing the passphrase: it is the secret protecting your data. People with both access to the repository and knowledge of the passphrase can read your backups.\nDO NOT LOSE OR FORGET THE PASSPHRASE: it is not stored anywhere and can’t be recovered in case of loss. A lost passphrase means the data within the repository can no longer be recovered.\nIt is also possible to create unencrypted repositories, should your backups remain local, in which case the -no-encryption option has to be passed at creation:\n$ plakar at /var/backups create -no-encryption Note that once a repository is created, it is no longer possible to change its configuration, such changes require creating a new repository and performing a synchronization between old and new repository.\nCreating your first local backup Once the repository is created, we can do the first backup to it:\n$ plakar at /var/backups backup /private/etc 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/ftpusers 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/asl/com.apple.iokit.power 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/pam.d/screensaver_new_ctk [...] 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/apache2 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private 9abc3294: OK ✓ / backup: created unsigned snapshot 9abc3294 of size 3.1 MB in 72.55875ms You can verify that it is properly recorded:\n$ plakar at /var/backups ls 2025-02-19T21:38:16Z 9abc3294 3.1 MB 0s /private/etc Verify the integrity of its content:\n$ plakar at /var/backups check 9abc3294 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/afpovertcp.cfg 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-autoindex.conf 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-dav.conf [...] 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/xtab 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/zshrc 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc check: verification of 9abc3294:/private/etc completed successfully And restore it to a local directory:\n$ plakar at /var/backups restore -to /tmp/restore 9abc3294 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/afpovertcp.cfg 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-autoindex.conf 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-dav.conf [...] 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/xtab 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/zprofile 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/zshrc 9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal restore: restoration of 9abc3294:/private/etc at /tmp/restore completed successfully $ ls -l /tmp/restore total 1784 -rw-r--r--@ 1 gilles wheel 515 Feb 19 22:47 afpovertcp.cfg drwxr-xr-x@ 9 gilles wheel 288 Feb 19 22:47 apache2 drwxr-xr-x@ 16 gilles wheel 512 Feb 19 22:47 asl [...] -rw-r--r--@ 1 gilles wheel 0 Feb 19 22:47 xtab -r--r--r--@ 1 gilles wheel 255 Feb 19 22:47 zprofile -r--r--r--@ 1 gilles wheel 3094 Feb 19 22:47 zshrc -rw-r--r--@ 1 gilles wheel 9335 Feb 19 22:47 zshrc_Apple_Terminal Viewing the backup with the web interface Plakar provides a web interface to view the backups and their content. To start the web interface, run:\n$ plakar at /var/backups ui Your default browser will open a new tab. You can navigate through the snapshots, view the files, and restore them.\nDigression: one copy is not enough You’ve completed a backup, which is great. However, if you’ll allow me, I’d like to digress for a moment:\nLiterature and empirical studies suggest that the annual probability of data loss at a single site—especially when considering factors like hardware failures, human error, and environmental risks—is typically in the low single-digit percentages. For example, a seminal study by Pinheiro, Weber, and Barroso (2007) titled “Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population” found that hard drive failure rates generally fall in the range of 2% to 4% per year. In practice, when additional risks beyond basic hardware failure (such as accidental deletion or other operational issues) are factored in, many practitioners adopt a conservative estimate of around 5% per year for a single site.\nA local backup, as we just did, is helpful in case of accidental removal of the original data… but not so much if the storage is entirely lost.\nAs explained in the page One repository is not enough, the probability of losing data is as follows:\nFor a single set of data: 5% per year (1 in 20 chance) For two copies at distinct sites: 0.00069% per year (1 in 145,000 chance) For three copies at distinct sites: 0.0000001% per year (1 in a billion chance) To reduce the risk of data loss, it is highly recommended to create multiple copies of your backups across different locations.\nCreating a second copy over SFTP We now have a local repository with a copy of our backups, but it is done on the same machine: we’re currently at 5% chances of losing data this year if the drive dies.\nPlakar has been designed to make it easy to synchronize repositories across multiple locations. Let’s create another repository on my remote NAS over SFTP and synchronize it with the local one: it should not take more than a couple of minutes.\nWhat is SFTP? SFTP is the Secure File Transfer Protocol that comes with OpenSSH.\nThis can be done by creating a new repository there, with its own passphrase:\n$ plakar at sftp://gilles@nas.plakar.io/var/backups create repository passphrase: repository passphrase (confirm): We could simply do a new backup to it, but this might produce different snapshots as data may have changed since the first backup.\nInstead, we can perform a repository synchronization.\nA repository synchronization ensures that backups are transfered from a repository to another, using the recorded data,and performing necessary decryption and encryption to produce a similar copy:\n$ plakar at /var/backups sync to sftp://gilles@nas.plakar.io/var/backups peer repository passphrase: peer repository passphrase (confirm): sync: synchronized 1 snapshot info: sync: synchronization from /var/backups to sftp://gilles@nas.plakar.io/var/backups completed: 1 snapshots synchronized $ plakar at sftp://gilles@nas.plakar.io/var/backups ls 2025-02-19T21:38:16Z 9abc3294 3.1 MB 0s /private/etc We can verify integrity of the snapshot on the second repository:\n$ plakar at sftp://gilles@nas.plakar.io/var/backups check 9abc3294 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/afpovertcp.cfg 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-autoindex.conf 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-dav.conf [...] 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/xtab 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/zshrc 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc check: verification of 9abc3294:/ completed successfully The probability of losing data this year has now fallen from 5% to 0.00069% (1 in 145,000)!\nCreating a third copy over S3 But what if both my drive died AND the data center hosting my NAS burst in flames?\nLet’s create yet another repository on a remote S3 bucket!\n$ plakar config repository create s3 # for AWS, set s3://s3.\u003cregion\u003e.amazonaws.com/\u003cbucket\u003e $ plakar config repository set s3 location s3://minio.plakar.io:9001/mybackups $ plakar config repository set s3 passphrase **************** $ plakar config repository set s3 access_key gilles $ plakar config repository set s3 secret_access_key ******** $ plakar at @s3 create Let’s do another synchronization!\n$ plakar at /var/backups sync to @s3 sync: synchronization from /var/backups to s3://minio.plakar.io:9001/mybackups completed: 1 snapshots synchronized $ plakar at @s3 ls 2025-02-19T21:38:16Z 9abc3294 3.1 MB 0s /private/etc We can verify integrity of the snapshot on the third repository:\n$ plakar at @s3 check 9abc3294 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/afpovertcp.cfg 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-autoindex.conf 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-dav.conf [...] 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/xtab 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/zshrc 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal 9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc check: verification of 9abc3294:/private/etc completed successfully The probability of losing data has now fallen from 0.00069% to 0.0000001% (1 in a billion)!\nA few additional words on synchronization Repository synchronization is slightly more advanced than what was shown, and you are encouraged to experiment with it to find the best worflow for your use-case.\nThis first command locates snapshots that exist in my local repository but not in the remote one, then sends them over:\n$ plakar at /var/backups sync to @s3 This second command locates snapshots that exist in the remote repository but not in the local one to bring them over:\n$ plakar at /var/backups sync from @s3 And this last command does it both ways, pushing to the remote repositories snapshots that exist locally and are missing, but also fetching locally snapshots that only exist remotely:\n$ plakar at /var/backups sync with @s3 In addition, all these commands support passing snapshot identifiers and various options to perform partial synchronizations, only exchanging snapshots that match certain criterias.

You can have one or many different repositories, some encrypted and others not, synchronized one with each other or not, and each backed by a local filesystem, a mounted filesystem, an object storage or even a remote server.\nThey should be considered as locations, rather than directories: you point the utility there so it can store snapshots or retrieve data from snapshots.\nThe following command will for example create a repository in /tmp/plakar:\n$ plakar at /tmp/plakar create -no-encryption $ While the following command will list the snapshots that are part of that repository:\n$ plakar at /tmp/foobar ls $ None here as the repository was just created and is empty.\nSnapshots Repositories are useless without backups.\nThe plakar utility creates backups from directories. It scans their content and builds an internal representation of what’s necessary to rebuild an exact copy, both of the filesystem structure and files, then records that representation as a versioned snapshot in a repository:\n$ plakar at /tmp/foobar backup /bin $ plakar at /tmp/foobar ls 2022-04-08T21:38:50Z 21a403b1-b022-40dd-95ad-5b78a90360dd 13 MB /bin $ Snapshots are space efficient as they may contain the same files as other snapshots without having to store their own copies, creating multiple snapshots of the same directory will consume roughly the size a single copy would consume with a little overhead due to snapshot-specific metadata:\n$ plakar at /tmp/foobar backup /bin $ plakar at /tmp/foobar backup /bin $ plakar at /tmp/foobar backup /bin $ plakar at /tmp/foobar backup /bin $ plakar at /tmp/foobar ls 2022-04-08T21:38:50Z 21a403b1-b022-40dd-95ad-5b78a90360dd 13 MB /bin 2022-04-08T21:38:51Z 976ed175-206a-418d-b960-7d0736d41b46 13 MB /bin 2022-04-08T21:38:51Z 8271734e-882c-47b4-812a-5bef3455281c 13 MB /bin 2022-04-08T21:38:52Z 273c9764-eae3-4e4f-8bcd-39538b684b49 13 MB /bin 2022-04-08T21:38:52Z 70e1de7a-e410-4ad4-b441-f4f40977232b 13 MB /bin $ du -sh /tmp/foobar 4.0M /tmp/foobar $ In some situations, such as above, the space consumed will even be smaller than that of a single snapshot as the snapshot may contain duplicate information itself, or may compress well.\nContrarily to incremental backups, snapshots are truly independent one from another and do not assume the existence of any other snapshot.
